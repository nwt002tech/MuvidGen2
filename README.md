# MuVidGen – Pixar-Style 3D Preset (Streamlit Secrets Ready)

This build defaults to **Pixar-inspired 3D** visuals and adds character-consistency helpers.
It still works **fully free** (Streamlit Cloud + Hugging Face Inference API token) and falls back to animated text cards if the API isn't available.

## Streamlit Secret
Set your secret in Streamlit Cloud:
```toml
HF_TOKEN="YOUR_HF_TOKEN"
```

## Notes on Style
This app aims for *Pixar-inspired* family-friendly 3D: soft studio lighting, subsurface scattering,
expressive eyes, clean stylization. It **does not replicate proprietary Pixar IP or characters**.
